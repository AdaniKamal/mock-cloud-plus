    "question": "A cloud engineer is in charge of deploying a platform in an laaS public cloud. The application tracks the state using session cookies, and there are no affinity restrictions. Which of the following will help the engineer reduce monthly expenses and allow the application to provide the service?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Resource metering",
      "B": "Reserved resources",
      "C": "Dedicated host",
      "D": "Pay-as-you-go model"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A pay-as-you-go model would be beneficial for the cloud engineer because it allows the application to be scaled based on demand, reducing monthly expenses since costs are only incurred for the resources actually used. Since there are no affinity restrictions and the application uses session cookies for state tracking, the pay-as-you-go model can handle fluctuating workloads without the need to pay for unused reserved resources or dedicated hosts."

      "B": "Replatform",
      "C": "Retain",
      "D": "Refactor"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The most cost-effective and efficient strategy when migrating to the cloud can often be to 'retire' or turn off legacy systems that are no longer useful or necessary. This avoids spending resources on migrating and maintaining systems that do not provide value in a cloud environment"

    "question": "An engineer made a change to an application and needs to select a deployment strategy that meets the following requirements:\n• Is simple and fast\n• Can be performed on two Identical platforms\nWhich of the following strategies should the engineer use?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blue-green",
      "B": "Canary",
      "C": "Rolling",
      "D": "in-place"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The blue-green deployment strategy is ideal for scenarios where simplicity and speed are crucial. It involves two identical production environments: one (blue) hosts the current application version, while the other (green) is used to deploy the new version. Once testing is completed on the green environment and it's ready to go live, traffic is switched from blue to green, ensuring a quick and efficient rollout with minimal downtime. This method allows for immediate rollback if issues arise, by simply redirecting the traffic back to the blue environment."

    "question": "A cloud consultant needs to modernize a legacy application that can no longer address user demand and is expensive to maintain. Which of the following is the best migration strategy?",

      "A": "Retain",
      "B": "Rehost",
      "C": "Refactor",
      "D": "Replatform"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. In cloud computing, it often means modifying the application to better leverage cloud-native features and services. This can address user demand and reduce maintenance costs by making the application more scalable, resilient, and manageable."

      "C": "Cost benefit analysis",
      "D": "User acceptance testing"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Before a configuration change is deployed in the cloud production environment, it is crucial to conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT). UAT involves testing the system by the end-users or clients to ensure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications. This testing is the final stage before the change is approved for production, ensuring that all functionalities meet user requirements and the system is ready for deployment"
